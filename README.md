This is a fork of the original sketch for the Bulbdial Clock sold by http://evilmadscience.com.

This version includes 4 modes of fading:
  0 - no fading
  1 - original fading 
  2 - move hour hand ahead at 31 minutes after the hour
  3 - continuous fading of all 3 hands
  
To select the Fade mode, enter the "Optional" configuration mode by holded + and Z buttons
for 3 seconds.  Then select one of the 4 modes using the + and - buttons.  The buttons do 
not "wrap", to make it easier to figure out where you are.

The program has also been updated it for use with the Arduino 1.0.4 IDE and the Time.h library.
